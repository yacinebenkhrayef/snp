# Leveraging Graph Databases in HR Systems using Neo4j


## Objective: 
To model HR data as a graph and explore the use of graph databases (Neo4j) to uncover hidden patterns in hiring, team dynamics, and employee mobility. 


## Background: 
Traditional relational databases fail to capture the complexity of real-world RH interactions: 
referrals, role transitions, skill overlaps, team dependencies. Graph databases enable more powerful queries and visual analytics. 


#### Tasks: 
● Study existing HR data structure (candidates, employees, skills, roles, relationships). 
● Model it using graph structures (nodes: people, skills, jobs; edges: has_skill, worked_with, referred_by, etc.). 
● Implement graph database using Neo4j or similar. 
● Create meaningful queries: 
      ○ Find best internal candidates for a new position. 
      ○ Identify influencers or knowledge hubs in the company. 
      ○ Visualize hiring bottlenecks or skill gaps. 
● Optionally build a simple dashboard for query access. 


#### Expected Outcome: 
● A functional graph database implementation. 
● A set of high-value queries and insights. 
● Prototype dashboard or visualization. 
● A report demonstrating the benefits of graph modeling for HR. 



#### Skills Required: 
● Graph database experience (Neo4j, Cypher) 
● Data modeling 
● Some HR context knowledge 
● Data visualization (e.g., D3.js, Plotly, or Neo4j Bloom)





## data
Here’s a summary of why this dataset is an excellent foundation for the project:

Real-world Applicability:
The inclusion of properties like attrition, job_satisfaction, and performance_rating, inspired by the IBM HR Attrition Dataset, makes the dataset highly relevant for addressing real business challenges.

Deep Analytical Potential:
The detailed information on career progression (years_in_current_role, years_since_last_promotion), employee demographics (education_level, marital_status), and relationships (REFERRED_BY, MENTORS) enables a wide range of sophisticated analyses, from predicting employee turnover to identifying key factors for professional growth.

Robust Structure:
The graph-based model, with its defined nodes and relationships, provides a clear and intuitive way to explore the complex connections within an organization. This structure is perfect for visualizing and querying information that would be difficult to represent in a traditional relational database.

Enables Machine Learning: 
The dataset is well-structured to serve as a foundation for machine learning models, particularly for predicting attrition or understanding the drivers of high performance_rating.

In short, the dataset is a powerful tool for any project aiming to explore the intricacies of human resources data and derive actionable insights from it.
